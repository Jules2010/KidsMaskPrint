Once a mask has been created, it can be worn.  We suggest that masks are printed onto card (then maybe laminated).
<br><br>
Make two holes for the eyes, these don't have to be in the position of the eyes on the mask.  But should be cut to suite the wearer of the mask.
<br><br>
Next make two smaller holes to attach some elastic.
