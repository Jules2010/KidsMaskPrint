Once you have purchased Kids Mask Factory you will be provided with a license key. This will be a main program license key, which you will need to paste into the 'Parent Options' -> 'Help' -> 'Enter License Code' screen.<BR><BR>

If you then decide to buy some mask packs, you will need to use the 'Parent Options' -> 'Help' -> 'Buy Mask Packs' screen. Here you must produce a serial code, which must be provided when you order your mask pack.<BR><BR>

You can not buy mask packs without buying a main program license first.
