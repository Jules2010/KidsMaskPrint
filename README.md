# How to build / edit the code

You’ll need Microsoft Visual Basic .Net 2003, you can download this as part of your MSDN benefits.

You will also probably need to use Windows 7 or earlier.

Perhaps in the future I may upgrade this project if this becomes a popular request.

I have included a Components folder which includes most of the required DLLs.

You’ll notice there are two project files for Kids Mask Print and a number of DLLs suffixed with Debug, these are added to one solution for easier debugging. (Why, well there needs to be separate solution to allow for obfuscating / strong name signing, which is used in the batch files.)

So the easiest way to compile the project is to open \CodeLibrary\SharewareProjs\IdeasPad\IdeasPadDebug.sln XXXX

However you can also use the batch files in the build folder, start with the DLLs.

# Installation

XXXX
You can install the app via [Ideaspad.msi](https://github.com/Jules2010/Ideaspad/raw/master/Build/IPStandard/DistBuild/Ideaspad.msi) which will inform you about any system requirements you don't already have.
