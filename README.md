Kids Mask Print is windows desktop app aimed at kids and parents. 

It allows kids to create cool masks out of a range of face parts. 

Then can then either print the black white mask and colour in with felt tip pen. Or use the application to colour in the mask for you. 

It allows multiple kids to save their own accounts and masks.

# Background

Kids Mask Print was written between XXXXX.

Although Kids Mask Print was written in VB.Net, later I moved to Real Basic, as at the time the Dot Net Framework download was quite a burden, with lack of capacity in Internet access. 

With Real Basic I also changed the name of the app to Kids Mask Factory.

# How to build / edit the code

You’ll need Microsoft Visual Basic .Net 2003, you can download this as part of your MSDN benefits.

You will also probably need to use Windows 7 or earlier.

Perhaps in the future I may upgrade this project if this becomes a popular request.

I have included a Components folder which includes most of the required DLLs.

You’ll notice there are two project files for Kids Mask Print and a number of DLLs suffixed with Debug, these are added to one solution for easier debugging. (Why, well there needs to be separate solution to allow for obfuscating / strong name signing, which is used in the batch files.)

So the easiest way to compile the project is to open \CodeLibrary\SharewareProjs\IdeasPad\IdeasPadDebug.sln XXXX

However you can also use the batch files in the build folder, start with the DLLs.

# Installation

You can install the app via [kmpinst.exe](https://github.com/Jules2010/KidsMaskPrint/raw/master/Build/KMP/Nsis/kmpinst.exe) which will inform you about any system requirements you don't already have.
